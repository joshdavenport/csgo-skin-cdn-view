# CS:GO Skin CD Images Viwer (csgo-skin-cdn-view)
As part of a recent CS:GO update volvo have added offical CDN URLs for all images of all skins in the game. This is a viewer that allows you see all of those images in a browser and search by their names. I'll endeavor to keep the list up to date after changes to the list of CDN URLs from new updates.

Here's an [online version of the viewer](http://joshdavenport.github.io/csgo-skin-cdn-view/).
